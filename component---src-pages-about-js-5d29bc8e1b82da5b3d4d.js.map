Uong graduated from the University of California, San Diego\n        with a degree in Structural Engineering (emphasis on geotechnical design\n        and computational analysis) and Carnegie Mellon in M.S Computational\n        Mechanics. He is the recipient of the American Society of Civil\n        Engineers award and scholar of the Leo Politi Foundation. Uong is\n        perhaps best known for his natural curiosity, willingness and dedication\n        for learning, and pragmatic approach on solving problems.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>üë®‚Äçüíª Career </h4>\n      <p>\n        At a young age, Uong had a candid characteristic to break things apart\n        and put them back together and this attitude brought out this true\n        passion in Computational Mechanics where he is able to wander endlessly\n        in the world of mathematics and science. He later discovered his true\n        passion in computer science and is now pursuing it full time. This site\n        contains a collection of his numerous projects that he is excited to\n        share with you!\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>‚úàÔ∏è + ‚ù§Ô∏è Cultural Diversity</h4>\n      <p>\n        With a great sense for cultural awareness, Uong has visited over 30\n        countries. With no hesitation and fear, he stepped onto new territories\n        and allowed his experiences to diversify his view of the world. Uong\n        continues to believe that a worldly experience can lead to success and\n        acceptance. For Uong, knowledge is power and with power, comes the\n        ability to positively influence people's lives. Each time he traveld\n        abroad, he obtained a vast knowledge of their culture and gained a\n        better appreciation of his own.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>üî≠ Future </h4>\n      <p>\n        In his spare time, Uong likes to play his Rodriguez flamenco guitar,\n        pick up a computer language, or go for a jog. His next big move in life\n        is to earn an MBA to advance his career and save money to travel to the\n        Mediterranean! :)\n      </p>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"names":["Layout","title","className","src","image","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
