Gatsby is a buzzword in the web development field that I have been hearing for a while and always wanted to explore. Specifically, I wanted to learn about static site generators. Historically, we have always had client-side rendering and server-side rendering and they each have pros and cons, I was particularly interested in learning how static-side generation was going to solve some of these problems.

The user experience on a SSG build is superb because all the HTML pages are all already generated. Gatsby takes templates, components, and data to generate static HTML pages in build time. JAMstack is a modern architecture for building websites and applications. Traditionally, we have CMS like Wordpress that requires a database to store content and there's also a presentation layer of template files that mix HTML with template tags. In this type of architecture, the frontend and backend are tightly coupled. Both the content and how itâ€™s presented are part of the same code base (aka monolithic architecture). In a JAMstack architecture, these ends are decoupled. The frontend static resources (HTML, CSS, JS) are generated by Gatsby during the build process and the backend is any content API that returns a JSON or XML or even markdowns (which I use for this blogging site).

### Development and Deployment
To run the dev server, `yarn develop`
To build and deploy, first run `yarn build` to build the static files. Deploy this folder to your favorite web server.

### Blogging
Gatsby configuration is all set up for you. Just need to add markdown files in the `markdown` folder and retrieve with GraphQL.
